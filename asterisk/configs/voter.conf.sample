port = 667			;			
buflen = 220			; specifies the receiver buffer length in milliseconds.
				; This parameter should be set to the maximum expected network latency,
				; plus a little padding (100 milliseconds of padding is a good amount).
				;  The default is 500 milliseconds,
				; Buffer length may be specified on a perstanza and per-client basis

password = BLAH			; password common to all clients This is sent from server to all clients. (default = BLAH)

Main = radios,transmit		; master,transmit,adpcm,nulaw,nodeemp,buflen=value,gpsid[=value]
				; master - this client is the Master Timing source
				; secret - password unique to this client This is sent from client to server. (default = radios)
				; (the RTCM client that is on the same LAN as the Asterisk server.)
				; There can only be 1 Master Timing source  per entire Asterisk server.
				; transmit - this client is intended to have transmit audio sent to it and will have a transmitter connected to it.
				; adpcm - this client is to be sent audio in ADPCM format, rather than Mulaw.
				; nulaw - this client is to be sent audio in 4000 samples/second Mulaw (Nulaw, as we call it), rather than the standard 8000 samples/second.
				; nodeemp - this client is not to perform de-emphasis of the receiver audio  (This is only to be used with non-voting clients.)
				; buflen=value - buffer length for this client only.
				; gpsid[=value] - This specifies a gps identity to associate with the specified client (as referred in the /etc/asterisk/gps.conf file).

                                ; On the TX side, the RTCM/VOTER expects the repeater to accept mic audio.
                                ; In other words, the repeater is providing the pre-emphasis, not the RTCM/VOTER (you are not directly modulating the TX).
                                ; This can be overridden by setting CTCSS tone in voter.conf. If a CTCSS tone is defined, the RTCM will provide pre-emphasis to the audio,
                                ; and expects that you will be connecting to your repeater's flat audio input (direct modulation).

                                ; If you donâ€™t want TX CTCSS tone but do need pre-emphasis, set an arbitrary (any) CTCSS tone in voter.conf, and set the level to 0.
                                ; This will force the RTCM/VOTER to pre-emphasize the audio it generates on the TX pin, but it won't actually mix in a CTCSS tone.
